		<h1>Sign up to volunteer?</h1>
		<p>Thank you for helping us make this party a blast! We had a bunch of people offer to help for most categories - please find the category you volunteered to help with below for instructions. Everything is super casual and we want everyone to have fun enjoying the party and participating in events, so just help out wherever and whenever you are able throughout the day. Thanks again!</p>

		<h2>Potluck </h2>

		<p>Feel free to bring whatever your heart desires and let us know ahead of time if you like!  Potluck starts at 2pm.</p>


		<h2>Setting up</h2>

		<p>Feel free to start coming over after noon. If we have anything we need help with we will put you to work! Otherwise, we shall start the party early (shhh… don’t tell the others). If you are driving over and would like to check in with us in the morning, we can let you know if there’s anything we might need you to pick up for us at the last minute. </p>


		<h2>Food & Drink </h2>

		<p>Please keep an eye on the food and drink area throughout the event and replenish items as needed. We will let you know where to find our stash. </p>


		<h2>Grilling/BBQ </h2>

		<p>If you volunteered to Grill/BBQ, we plan on firing things up at 2pm. We have a handful of folks interested in helping out, so please check in with whoever is manning the grill to see if they’d like someone else to tap in. We will provide the food but you’re welcome to bring something to cook if you like! </p>


		<h2>Face Painting </h2>

		<p>Face painting will take place in the arts & crafts booth and we will provide the supplies! Same vibe as the BBQ station, but with less folks participating. We will create times based on your preference for offering face painting. </p>


		<h2>General Event Assistant </h2>

		<p>Calling all event assistants! Check in with us when you get here and we will let you know how you can help. </p>


		<h2>Clean Up </h2>

		<p>Clean up crew: thanks for wanting to help! It would be amazing if some of you could keep an eye on trash cans and change them out as needed throughout the day. We will have a designated area for full bags. We will leave chairs, tents, etc out through the long weekend as folks camp and come by to hang out. Crafts, food and other party specific supplies can be tucked away in the garage at the end of the evening. </p>


		<h2>I’m Brave </h2>

		<p>For the brave brave honeys. Oh honey. Bring your bathing suits - if you dare. </p>


		<h2>Performance</h2>

		<p>If you have anything you would like to present - be it a toast, music, speech or otherwise - please find our sign up sheet when you arrive. We’re lookin’ forward to an unpredictable evening! </p>
