	<h2>Parking and Getting To/From the Casino:</h2>
 
	<p style="width:60%">We should have room for everyone who has a vehicle to park on site. Please consider carpooling over from the casino if you are able just in case. If you don’t know any other party guests staying at the casino, let us know and we might be able to hook you up with some new friends to ride over with. Especially if you will be without a vehicle!</p>

	<p style="width:60%">We also have two lovely helpers on standby, as the casino is only 5 minutes down the road. If you would like to utilize our volunteer designated drivers, please respond to this email with your phone number so they can text you on party day to coordinate picking you up and dropping you off at Angel of the Winds. There will be general time slots for shuttling folks: 12:00, 1:30pm, 3pm, 6pm & 8pm. This is not set in stone, so don’t fret - just let us know what you need and we will take care of you.</p>

	<p style="width:60%">The casino is a two mile walk and the main road has a walk/bike path. It is a hilly mosey, and the internet thinks you should be able to do it in 43 minutes if you’re into that.</p>
