		<h1>FAQs</h1>


		<h2>What’s the best way to get from SeaTac to Arlington?</h2>

		<p style="width:60%">If you will not have a vehicle, let us know how we can help get you where you need to be:
		The light rail/sound transit can get you as far as lynwood for a few dollars per person if you have someone to pick you up (about 30 minutes from Arlington) 
		Bellair Shuttle from SeaTac to Stanwood Chevron Station (about 10 minutes to party/casino) </p>

		<h2>What should I wear? </h2>

		<p style="width:60%">This will be a pretty casual event so please wear what you feel most comfortable in for an outdoor party and take weather into consideration. It cools down to the 50s here after dark - so make sure to bring a jacket, blanket, or whatever you need to keep you comfy and cozy. </p>

		<p style="width:60%">We recommend shoes that are comfortable for walking sloped/grassy terrain. As you may know… we have farm animals, therefore, we do not recommend brand new white shoes or pointy heels.</p>


		<h2>Should I bring anything special?</h2>

		<ol>
			<li>Swimsuit and towel if you plan to participate in all activities ;-) </li>
			<li>Camp chairs if you are local </li>
			<li>Picnic blanket if you have room</li>
			<li>Sunscreen/bug spray/hat/sunglasses as desired</li>
			<li>Reusable water bottle</li>
			<li>Any white clothing that might be in need of an upgrade - we will have a tye-dye station! </li>
		</ol>

		<h2>Will we be hanging out at the river? </h2>

		<p style="width:60%">The main party will be in our backyard. If you are into water events, make sure to bring a bathing suit as there will be some splashing around the fest! 

		<p style="width:60%">We live on the Stillaguamish river and it is accessible to those who are able bodied and can safely navigate uneven and steep terrain. We recommend you wear water shoes and a bathing suit if you plan to explore. The river is mostly shallow during summer, with some deep areas - pending no heavy rains. If you wander down there, please be safe, bring a buddy, and no unattended minors - we have life jackets of all sizes. </p>

		<h2>Are kids welcome?</h2>

		<p style="width:60%">Yes! This is a family friendly event. Make sure to bring their bathing suit, towels, and a change of clothing. </p>

		<h2>Are dogs welcome?</h2>

		<p style="width:60%">Unless we have spoken about it ahead of time, please leave your pups at home. We will have two of our dogs here: Patch & Gus. Patch is white and black, will likely bark to greet you, and is super friendly. Gus came to us from a rescue last fall and is a sweet boy and kid friendly, but sometimes he gets scared of strangers. If anyone is uncomfortable around dogs for any reason, please let us know and we will put them away. </p>

		<h2>What if I am camping overnight?</h2>

		<p style="width:60%">We will have campsite areas for tent set-ups. Bring warm clothing and a sleeping bag that will keep you cozy in 40/50 degree nighttime temps. Please let us know if you need any supplies or have any questions about staying here. We might have a few sleeping bags and tents to spare. </p>
